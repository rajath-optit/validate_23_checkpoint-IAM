## Part 1: EBS Volume Management

### Overview
This section covers automation of AWS EBS volumes management by implementing security best practices including encryption and deletion management. It processes volumes based on CSV input and implements changes in a controlled, logged manner.

### Pre-deployment IAM Requirements

#### Required IAM Permissions
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute",
                "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                "ec2:CreateVolume",
                "ec2:DeleteVolume",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### IAM Setup Steps
1. Create a new IAM policy using the JSON above
2. Create a new IAM role or user specifically for this automation
3. Attach the policy to the role/user
4. Configure AWS credentials using the role/user
5. Verify access using `aws sts get-caller-identity`

### Impact Assessment

#### Changes Made by the Script
1. **Encryption Enhancement**
   - Creates encrypted copies of unencrypted volumes
   - Generates temporary snapshots during encryption process
   - Creates new encrypted volumes in the same availability zone

2. **Deletion Management**
   - Enables DeleteOnTermination flag for attached volumes
   - Modifies instance attributes for attached volumes

### Best Practices Implemented
1. **Security**
   - Enforces EBS volume encryption
   - Implements proper volume lifecycle management
   - Ensures secure deletion practices

2. **Operations**
   - Implements retry logic for AWS operations
   - Validates all prerequisites before execution
   - Maintains detailed logging and audit trail

3. **Resource Management**
   - Tracks volume state changes
   - Manages resource cleanup
   - Handles errors gracefully

### CSV File Requirements

#### Format
```csv
resource,status
vol-1234567890abcdef0,alarm
vol-0987654321fedcba0,ok
```

#### Fields
- `resource`: Volume ID or ARN
- `status`: Must be "alarm" for processing

# Part 2: EC2 Security Compliance

## Overview
This section implements comprehensive security compliance checks and remediation for AWS EC2 resources including instances, AMIs, and related components. It enforces security best practices and compliance requirements through automated checks and modifications.
